# Super Simple File Sorter
A super simple file sorter based on user-defined categories!

You are expected to understand what Python is and have Python 3 installed.

This file sorter is designed to be simple a double-click-to-run program. No matter where you download this repository, you just have to double click `main.py` to run the program.

Simply supply the directory you would like to sort (Example: C:\Users\Your Username\Downloads) and the program will guide you through any remaining steps. The program supports persistent categories! So if you define a category (Say: pictures) any time you run the program and supply a directory, any matching extensions in the pictures category will automatically be moved to a pictures folder in the directory you gave.
