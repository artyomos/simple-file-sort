# Super Simple File Sorter
A super simple file sorter based on user-defined categories!

You are expected to understand what Python is and have Python 3 installed.

## Steps to Run the Program:
This file sorter is designed to be simple a double-click-to-run program.

#### Download the repository from Github (Green button in top-right of repository)

Extract the file anywhere you wish, this thing runs based on a directory you supply.

No matter where you download this repository, you just have to double click `main.py` to run the program.

#### Simply supply the directory you would like to sort
(Example: C:\Users\Your Username\Downloads)

The program will guide you through any remaining steps.

## The program supports persistent categories!
So if you define a category (Say: pictures) any time you run the program and supply a directory, any matching extensions in the pictures category will automatically be moved to a pictures folder in the directory you gave.

Hope you enjoy!
