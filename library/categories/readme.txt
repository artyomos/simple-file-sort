Categories are automatically defined after the first run of this program.

You have the option to:

1. Run the program on a directory that needs to be sorted, and see the output it produces here

2. Create your own files that will be sorted.

If you prefer #2, follow this:

Your first line of the file MUST BE THIS (helps make sure it doesn't mess with wrong files)
(DO NOT EDIT) Simple File Sort Category File

Your file extension for your category file is .cat, with the file name being the category (the program will create it this way after first run either way, so you may duplicate your categories on acccident if you do not follow this. No ill effects are expected from duplicate category files due to how this program has been implemented.)

Your SOLE LINE in the file (ignore comments start with // (don't use, as the program WILL NOT copy over comments when file categories are overwritten))
CATEGORY (lowercase Recommended) = file_ext_1,file_ext_2,file_ext_3 etc.

IF you do use spaces, the program is build to strip those out and still operate fine. However, when overwriting it will not add spaces between file extensions.
